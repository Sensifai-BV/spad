1,Minimizing Distractions,Composition,Score,"Refined, Busy",Minimize distractions to highlight the main subject.,"Give a continuous score for this one between 0 and 100:
Value of 0: the image is very refined;
Value of 100: the image is very busy.
Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","This parameter measures the degree of visual distraction caused by secondary elements in the image. It assesses the extent to which these elements disrupt the clear perception of the main subject by analyzing visual density, clarity of hierarchy, and the risk of perceptual competition. This evaluation does not consider the overall aesthetics of the scene but solely the impact of these elements on the subject's legibility.

Scoring examples:
- 0: The image is very clean; the subject is isolated, with no visible competing elements around it.

- 50: The image contains some perceptible secondary elements, but their presence does not hinder the reading of the main subject.

- 100: The image is visually cluttered; numerous elements compete with the subject, making its perception difficult or ambiguous."
2,Subtle Complexity,Composition,Boolean,Does the image have fine details that may not be immediately obvious but add to the complexity of the image?,Fine details that may not be immediately evident but add to the image's complexity.,"Does the image have fine details that may not be immediately obvious but add to the complexity of the image? Elements in the image which have an importance in the story, e.g. a character which we cannot distinguish at first glance but which would be important.
Score type: Boolean (True/False).","This parameter identifies the presence of subtle visual or narrative details, often barely noticeable at first glance, but which enrich the interpretation of the image once discovered. This could be a character in the background, a secondary gesture, a reflection, or a visual clue that gains significance later. This criterion does not concern overall visual density, but rather an image's ability to reveal meaningful elements after a delay.

Examples:
– True: A secondary silhouette in a mirror, a subtle symbol integrated into the background, a narrative detail revealed after careful observation.

– False: An immediately legible image where all elements are apparent and predictable, or details that, while numerous, add nothing to the understanding or narrative of the image."
3,Frame in a frame,Composition,Boolean,Does the image use elements in the scene to frame the subject?,Use elements in the scene to frame the subject.,"Does the image use elements in the scene to frame the subject?
Score type: Boolean.","This parameter detects the use of scene elements explicitly serving to visually frame the subject in a compositional manner. These can be openings (doors, windows), objects (branches, arches), or areas of light that create a framing structure within the image. This type of framing must be clearly discernible in the image's visual construction, and not simply due to the presence of elements near the subject without a formal function.

Examples:
– True: A subject photographed through an arch, a window, or framed by two walls, creating a clear boundary.

– False: The subject is surrounded by elements in the scene, but these do not form a perceptible or structuring visual frame."
4,Leading Space,Composition,Boolean,Does the image leave space in the direction of the subject'sgaze or movement?,Leave space in the direction of the subject's gaze or movement.,"Is the photograph effectively utilizing leading space by providing ample room in the direction of the subject's gaze or movement, maintaining visual balance, and adding narrative context to the image? Examine the image to ensure that the additional space enhances anticipation for the subject's actions, complements the composition's balance, and suggests a storyline beyond the frame.
Score type: Boolean.","This parameter assesses whether the image reserves open space in the direction of a subject's gaze or movement, thereby enhancing readability, visual balance, and compositional dynamism. This type of space allows the viewer to anticipate an action or extend the narrative beyond the frame, directing their gaze toward a significant area. It is not simply an empty space, but rather a space used intentionally as an extension of a narrative or directional axis.

Examples:
– True: A runner photographed with space in front of them, suggesting a race in progress; a portrait where the subject's gaze extends into an evocative void.

– False: The subject looks at or moves toward the edge of the image without reserved space; the empty space is present but without any perceptible connection to a narrative direction or intention."
5,Leading Lines,Composition,Boolean,Does the image use natural or artificial lines to direct the eye towards the subject?,Use natural or artificial lines to direct the eye towards the subject.,"Determine whether the image uses natural or artificial lines to direct the eyes towards the subject?
Score type: Boolean.","This parameter identifies the explicit use of natural lines (paths, shadows, branches, etc.) or artificial lines (walls, roads, structures, etc.) to guide the viewer's eye toward the main subject. These lines must be perceived as active visual vectors, creating a clear direction or convergence toward a point of interest. It is not enough for lines to simply be present in the image; they must play a structuring compositional role.

Examples:
– True: A road, a bridge, or a row of trees leading directly to the subject, creating a perspective or convergence effect.

– False: Lines present in the scene but not pointing toward the subject or contributing to the structuring of the viewer's perception."
6,Pattern Recognition,Composition,Boolean,Does the image seek to use repeating patterns or symmetrical arrangements?,Seek and use repetitive patterns or symmetrical arrangements.,"Does the image showcase a deliberate and orderly arrangement of elements which creates a visual rhythm through geometric repetition or symmetrical balance?
Score type: Boolean.","This parameter detects the intentional use of repetitive patterns, regular alignments, or symmetrical arrangements in image composition. These visual forms create a perceptual rhythm or a sense of order, often through the repetition of similar elements (objects, textures, silhouettes) or through balanced geometric organization. It is not simply a resemblance between elements, but a structured visual arrangement perceived as such by the viewer.

Examples:
– True: A series of aligned windows, characters forming a symmetrical line, or a sequence of identical objects placed at regular intervals.

– False: A scene containing similar objects but arranged irregularly or without any perceptible structure."
7,Composition Contrast,Composition,Score,"['Low', 'High']","Use differences in color, light, or texture to emphasize the subject.","Define here the importance of differences in color, light, or texture to emphasize the subject.
Value of 0: low compositional contrast;
At 100: high compositional contrast.
Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","This parameter measures the intensity with which the image uses differences in color, light, or texture to highlight the main subject. High compositional contrast creates a sharp visual separation between the subject and its surroundings, while low contrast conveys a smoother continuity or blending of elements. The goal is not to judge the image's quality, but rather to assess how well these contrasts contribute to the visual organization and hierarchy of the scene.

Examples of ratings:
- 0: The subject blends into the background, with little difference in light, color, or texture.
- 50: The contrast is moderate: the subject stands out but remains integrated into the overall scene.
- 100: The subject is strongly emphasized by a marked contrast in light, tone, or texture compared to its surroundings."
8,Depth of Field,Composition,Score,"['Sharp', 'Shallow']",Control the sharpness of the background to isolate the subject or show the environment.,"It controls the sharpness of the background to isolate the subject or show the environment.
Set the depth of field value here:
Value of 0: the image is completely sharp;
At 100: the image has a very shallow depth of field.
Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","This parameter measures the extent of the area of ​​sharpness in the image, in order to assess the depth of field used. A shallow depth of field corresponds to a very small area of ​​sharpness (usually around the main subject), with a blurred background; a large depth of field corresponds to sharpness extending across the entire scene. This measurement does not judge the intention or style, but rather how sharpness is distributed between the planes of the image.

Examples of ratings:
- 0: The entire scene is sharp, from the foreground to the background (landscape, architectural photography, etc.).
- 50: The subject is sharp, and the background begins to blur slightly, without being completely blurred.
- 100: The subject is isolated against a completely blurred background, with no sharp details in the environment."
9,Perspective Shift,Composition,Score,"Low angle, Steeply dipped",Change the perspective or angle to reveal unique aspects of the subject.,"It means changing the perspective or angle to reveal unique aspects of the subject. 
Set the perspective angle on a continuous scale from 0 to 100:
Value of 0: the image is in a strong low tilt;
At 50: Neutral; Image is neither taken from a low or a high angle.
At 100: the image is steeply dipped.
Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","This parameter measures the vertical orientation of the shooting perspective, on a scale ranging from an extreme low angle to a radical high angle. A low angle means the image is taken from a very low point, oriented upwards; a high angle refers to a high point, oriented downwards. A mid-range score corresponds to a neutral shot, taken at eye level. The score therefore reflects the direction and intensity of the vertical angle adopted by the photographer.

Examples of scoring:
- 0: Very pronounced low angle — the subject is seen from below, with a strong upward effect.

- 50: Neutral perspective — the subject is captured at eye level, without any perceptible tilt.

- 100: Radical high angle — the subject is seen from above, with a strong downward or downward effect."
10,Negative Space,Composition,Boolean,Does the image use empty space to highlight the subject?,Use empty space to highlight the subject and create a balanced composition.,"Does the image utilize empty areas surrounding the main subject to enhance its prominence?
Score type: Boolean.","This parameter identifies the deliberate use of empty or sparsely populated areas around the main subject to enhance its visibility, create visual tension, or structure the composition. Negative space is perceived as an active element of the image, highlighting the subject through contrast or isolation, without containing secondary narrative or visual information. This criterion is not limited to the mere presence of empty space, but also encompasses its intentional use as a graphic or narrative counterpoint.

Examples:
– True: A subject positioned against a vast, plain background, a silhouette against an empty sky, or a figure isolated amidst a minimal setting.

– False: An image with few elements where empty space does not structure the composition; or an empty background with no strong perceptual connection to the subject.

At 100: Yes.
Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","# 🧠 Prompt AI — Visual Texture Evaluation (v2.5)

## 🎭 ROLE

You are an **image critic specializing in texture analysis**.

Your mission: to evaluate **how actively textures contribute to the composition, depth, and narrative** of a photograph.

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Evaluate the **function** of textures in the image, not just their presence.

Focus on their ability to be:

* **Central and visually dominant**
* **Readable** (sharp, detailed, contrasted)
* **Active in the composition** (guiding the viewer's eye, hierarchy, rhythm)
* **Relevant to the narrative or atmosphere**

Textures should be **structural, not decorative**.

They must enhance the **visual tension**, **depth**, or **narrative intent** of the image.

---

## 📉 TO BE PENALIZED

* Textures **in the background**, **blurred**, or **without visual function**
* **Graphic or repetitive patterns** mistakenly taken for texture (circles, lines, tiles)
* Surface details **that do not influence the interpretation of the image**
* **Textures that are clearly visible but have no impact on the narrative or perception**
* **Presence of material not used visually** (e.g., smooth leather, polished metal, clean parquet flooring)
* **Reflections or lighting** should **never be confused with a substantial textural element**, even if they are based on a visible surface (e.g., puddles, shop windows, neon lights)
* **Ornaments, sculpted motifs, or narrative details** (architecture, frescoes, costumes) **should not be overemphasized** if the material itself **is not central to the interpretation**.

> ⚠️ A **repeated shape**, a **well-rendered surface**, or a **legible detail** is not enough.

> Texture must transform the perception, organization, or atmosphere** of the image. If the image would function **exactly the same without texture**, it is **not relevant**.

---

## 🌀 SPECIAL CASES

### Texture covering the entire image

Award a **high score (80–100)** only if:

* The material is **visually tangible** (cracking, grain, roughness, etc.)
* It **structures the reading** or generates **tension, immersion, or depth**

> ⚠️ A **repeating pattern covering the entire image** is **not enough** without a **strong and meaningful texture**.

### Graphic or Architectural Image

Do not give a high score if:

* The surfaces are smooth, clean, and regular, even when well-lit.
* The image relies on shapes or structures, without any perceptible texture.

Ask yourself:
**Would the image be the same if the surface details were blurred?**

If yes ➝ **texture is not an active factor.**

### Misused Texture (Trick)

Some textures **appear to be present** but do not **transform the image into a meaningful interpretation**:

* Banana peel, clean parquet flooring, leather, standard clothing, polished metal.

Even if clearly visible, these textures **should not be scored** unless they **convey a clear visual intention** (tension, symbolism, atmosphere).

### Urban or Cinematic Atmospheres

Even if an image contains textures (walls, floors, puddles), **they should only be emphasized if they directly contribute to the visual experience or immersion**.

> Be careful with street scenes, nighttime scenes, or cinematic images: if the visual impact relies on lighting, lines, or reflections, texture may appear present without being active. **Always test the blurry view** to confirm its relevance.

### Sculptures, Frescoes, Complex Details

> Do not confuse **sculpted narrative or decorative details** with **surface texture**.

> A visually rich image can have **very little texture** if its material **does not serve the visual experience** or **can be replaced by a flat pattern**.

---

## 🔍 TIP — Blurry Reading

Imagine the image blurred:
If the **material still structures perception**, **guides the eye**, or **creates volume**, the texture is relevant.

But if **the visual message remains unchanged**, or if the material becomes invisible without altering the reading experience, the texture is **decorative**.

---

## ✅ RATING

| Scale | Description |

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| **0–20** | Texture nonexistent, decorative, or without perceptual impact |

| **30–60** | Texture visible but secondary, or partially useful |

| **70–100** | Texture central, legible, and structuring to the reading experience or atmosphere |

---

## 🧾 CANONICAL EXAMPLES

### 🔸 Score 10:

A clean white wall, a neat floor with no visible irregularities, polished metal — **no tension or materiality exploited**.

### 🔸 Score 30:

A damp urban alleyway with a degraded floor and textured walls, but whose graphic impact would still rely on lighting and perspective, even if blurred.

### 🔸 Score 40:

A highly sculpted Gothic portal, but whose interpretation relies on figurative details rather than the materiality.

### 🔸 Score 50:

A sweater that is visible and sharp but secondary in the image, a slightly grainy surface with no narrative effect.

### 🔸 Score 70:

A wrinkled hand resting on a rough wooden table, where the material **carries the narrative or emotion**.

### 🔸 Score 90+:

Immersive close-up of a cracked wall, an organic surface that **structures the image** and **absorbs the gaze** through its sheer texture."
12,Perspective Lines,Composition,Score,"No, Yes",Use converging lines to create depth and guide the eye.,"Does the image have perspective lines?
Value of 0: No;
At 100: Yes.
Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","This parameter measures the presence and visual impact of converging lines in the composition, used to structure space, suggest depth, and guide the eye toward a focal point. These lines can originate from architecture, natural geometry, or the placement of elements within the scene. A high score corresponds to a composition clearly organized around perceptible vanishing lines; a low score indicates the absence or invisibility of any structuring perspective.

Examples of scoring:
- 0: No visible vanishing lines; the scene is not constructed according to a logic of perspective.
- 50: A slight perspective is suggested, but the lines are discreet or secondary in the interpretation of the image.
- 100: The image relies heavily on clear converging lines (road, corridor, rails, etc.), organizing the viewer's gaze and reinforcing depth."
13,Aspect Ratio,Composition,Radio,"Square, Horizontal, Vertical","Choosing between square, horizontal, or vertical formats affects the perception and reading speed of the image.","Choosing between 'Square', 'Horizontal', or 'Vertical' formats affects the perception and reading speed of the image; Felt on the image format.
Score type: text.","This parameter identifies the dominant visual format of the image, based on the ratio between the height and width of the frame. An image can be square (1:1 ratio), horizontal (wider than it is tall), or vertical (taller than it is wide). This choice influences the perception of the image, the flow of the viewer's gaze, and sometimes the relationship between the subject and its surroundings. The aim is not to judge the format used, but to recognize it for what it expresses in terms of visual composition.

Possible options:
– Square: The frame is as tall as it is wide, often used for symmetrical, centered, or graphic compositions.

– Horizontal: The frame is wider than it is tall; promotes a panoramic or expansive view of the scene.

– Vertical: The frame is taller than it is wide; often used for portraits or to emphasize upward movement."
14,Line Direction,Composition,List,"Horizontal, Oblique, Curved, Vertical, None","Horizontal lines inspire calm and stability, oblique lines dynamism and instability, and curved lines softness and soothing, vertical","Choose from 'Horizontal', 'Oblique', 'Curved', and 'Vertical'. Multiple choices may apply.
Horizontal lines inspire calm and stability, oblique lines dynamism and instability, and curved lines softness and soothing, vertical.
Score type: text.","This parameter describes the dominant directions of the lines visible in the image, identifying their role in the overall visual composition. These can be horizontal lines (stability, calm), vertical lines (elevation, tension), oblique lines (dynamism, imbalance), or curved lines (fluidity, softness). Several types of lines can coexist, but only those that truly structure the composition should be retained.

Possible choices:
– Horizontal: Lines parallel to the horizon, evoking stability, rest, or static equilibrium.

– Vertical: Ascending or descending lines, emphasizing height, tension, or authority.

– Oblique: Inclined or diagonal lines, creating a dynamic of movement, instability, or visual tension.

– Curved: Rounded, sinuous, or soft lines, generating a feeling of fluidity, organic quality, or calm.

– None: No dominant line type is identifiable or structuring in the composition."

## 🎭 Role

You are a **photo critic specializing in visual composition**, focusing on identifying **implicit lines**: those invisible yet perceptible alignments that guide the viewer's gaze and structure the interpretation of an image.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Identify, describe, and evaluate the quality of **implicit lines** present in the photograph, that is:

* The **undrawn visual connections** between elements of the image.

* The **perceived** paths that **guide the viewer's gaze** or **structure the composition**.

* The **graphic or directional** lines that are **not based on visible physical features**.

---

## ⚠️ Clear Definition

An **implicit line** is an **invisible perceptual connection** formed by:

* A subject's **gaze**, **gesture**, or **posture**.

* The **alignment** or **repetition** of **visually separated** objects.

* The **spatial symmetry** between several elements.

* The **rhythm** between distinct shapes, **color areas**, or **light values**.

* Frozen** or **anticipated** movement (jump, flight, momentum, etc.).

> It must **connect at least two distinct visual points**, create a **perceptual flow**, and **actively participate in the composition**.

> It is **not drawn or materialized** (no wire, bar, edge, or linear physical object).

---

## ❌ What is not an implicit line

Systematically rejects:

* **Visible lines**: wires, walls, edges, bars, structures, architecture.

* **Internal patterns** within an object (stripes, grooves, wood grain, branches, repetitive facade).

* The **symmetry or axis of a single object**.

* **Isolated gazes** without a focal point.

* Repetitions without perceptual connection (e.g., scattered birds without rhythm or direction).

* Any structure **that plays no active role in reading or storytelling**.

--

## 📏 Evaluation Criteria

Ask yourself these 3 questions:

1. Are one or more **coherent implicit lines** perceptible?

2. Do these lines **actually guide the eye**?

3. Do they contribute to a **clear, balanced, meaningful composition**?

---

## 🧮 Rating

**0** = No perceptible implicit lines.
**30–50** = Weak or partial implicit lines, with little structural impact.

**60–75** = Visible and clear implicit lines, contributing to readability.

**80–100** = Strong implicit lines, central to the composition, well-integrated, fluid, coherent, and graphic.

Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","This parameter measures the visual impact of lighting effects related to reflection or refraction on surfaces within the image. It identifies direct reflections (glass, mirrors, water), glare on shiny materials, and optical distortions caused by light passing through or bouncing off specific surfaces. The score reflects not only the presence of these phenomena but also their visible role in the image's composition or atmosphere.

Examples of scoring:
- 0: No reflective surfaces or optical effects are visible; light is diffused or absorbed without noticeable reflection.
- 50: One or more reflections are present (shiny surface, partial glare), but they do not dominate the visual experience.
- 100: The image relies heavily on reflected or refracted light: significant reflections, dominant optical effects, and an atmosphere built around reflection."
17,Point of Light,Composition,Score,"No, Yes",Bright elements or points of strong light that naturally capture attention.,"Bright elements or points of strong light that naturally capture attention.
Does the image have a bright spot?
Value of 0: No;
At 100: Yes.
Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","This parameter measures the presence of one or more clearly visible points of light in the image, whether they are direct sources (streetlights, sunlight, light bulbs), localized halos of light, or areas of high light intensity that immediately draw the eye. The score reflects both the visibility and the perceptual power of these light elements, as focal points or visual accents. This criterion does not concern overall exposure, but rather localized points that have a graphic or narrative role.

Examples of scoring:
- 0: No visible light source is identifiable in the image; the lighting is diffuse or indirect.
- 50: A point of light is present, perceptible but discreet, or integrated into the scene without dominating the composition.
- 100: One or more highly visible points of light focus the viewer's gaze, becoming dominant elements in the interpretation of the image."
18,Soft Focus,Composition,Score,"No, Yes",Mist or blur effect that reduces contrast and adds a touch of mystery or softness to the image.,"Does the image display a soft focus effect, characterized by a gentle blur and lowered contrast, which imbues the scene with an mystical, ethereal or dreamlike quality? This effect should not be mistaken for depth of field, which is related to the sharpness of certain areas in relation to the background or foreground.
Value of 0: There is no discernible soft focus effect present in the image;
At 100: The image prominently features a soft focus effect throughout, contributing significantly to its mood and style.
Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","This parameter measures the presence of a subtle, overall soft blur, accompanied by reduced contrast, which gives the image a gentle, hazy, or even dreamlike atmosphere. This visual effect is often used to evoke a sense of nostalgia, mystery, or timelessness. It should not be confused with depth of field, which relates to the relative sharpness between the subject and its surroundings, nor with accidental or technical blur.

Examples of ratings:
- 0: The image is perfectly sharp, with normal contrast, and no perceptible soft blur.

- 50: A slight blur is visible; the edges are softened, and the atmosphere begins to take on a softer tone without completely compromising clarity.

Harmony can arise from complementarity (colors opposite each other on the color wheel), analogy (nearby colors), or a subtle balance between hues, tones, and saturations. A high score corresponds to a palette perceived as fluid, coherent, or aesthetically well-controlled; a low score reflects visual dissonance, a lack of color structure, or a perceptual incompatibility between colors.

Examples of scoring:
- 0: The colors are discordant, garish, or disjointed, without any apparent visual logic.
- 50: Some colors harmonize well, but the palette remains partially unbalanced or incomplete.

23,Rule of thirds,Framing,Boolean,Does the framing of the image use the Rule of Thirds?,"Divides the image into thirds both horizontally and vertically, placing subjects at the intersections or along the lines.","Divides the image into thirds both horizontally and vertically, placing subjects at the intersections or along the lines.
Does the training of the image use the Rule of Thirds?
Score type: Boolean.","You are an experienced photography teacher reviewing a student's image. The photo is already displayed with a superimposed 3×3 grid, similar to the ""rule of thirds.""

Your task:
1. Identify the subject: In one short sentence, state what you consider to be the main subject or dominant visual element (e.g., ""a French bulldog in a hoodie,"" ""a red kayak on turquoise water,"" ""the city skyline"").

2. Remind them of the rule: The rule of thirds places important subjects or horizon lines along the vertical or horizontal lines of the grid or at one of the four intersections. Proper application generally means that the subject's focal point is located approximately one-ninth of the frame (≈ ±10% of the width/height) from a grid line or intersection.

3. Room for interpretation: a slight misalignment or intentional creativity. The discrepancy can still be considered if the image appears clearly balanced according to the rule of thirds. However, a subject placed in the center, close to an edge, or without discernible alignment should be considered a failure.

4. Decide – After weighing the pros and cons of the artistic intention, display only:

true: if the placement credibly adheres to the rule (including acceptable tolerance and artistic leeway); or

false: if it does not.

Additional details:

- To assist you in this task, the two horizontal and two vertical lines dividing the image into thirds are drawn on the photograph.

- Scoring type: Boolean (consider ""true"" only if the main subject is primarily and clearly located on a grid intersection or line; exceptionally, ""true"" may be awarded if the subject is very close to an intersection or line, constitutes the clear focal point in an empty or minimal frame, and shows obvious compositional intent).

- Main subject definition: The largest and most prominent object or person in the frame.

- Clarify scope: Evaluate only the main subject and mention secondary elements only if they are also clearly aligned with a grid line or intersection.

- Handling near misses: If the subject is close but not clearly on an intersection or line, specify the distance, explain the visual impact, and indicate whether contextual factors (focus, empty space, intention) justify a ""true"" misalignment despite a slight offset.

- Visual annotation reference: Explicitly reference the visual rule of thirds provided when describing the alignment or misalignment.

- Provide a very concise (no more than a few sentences) but detailed explanation of how the elements do (or do not) conform to this rule, with precise positional references, a justification based on the visual context if relevant, and a strict but considered standard for what is deemed compliant."

Does the image framing use The Golden Rectangle?
Score type: Boolean.","This parameter identifies whether the image composition relies on the use of rectangles proportioned according to the golden ratio (approximately 1.618), often called golden rectangles. These proportions can structure the frame or guide the placement of key visual elements. The presence of this construction should be perceptible in the overall layout of the image: precise asymmetrical balance, gradual interlocking, or fluid alignment according to these ratios.

Examples:
– True: The subject or main visual masses follow golden divisions, or are clearly contained within a perceptible golden spiral or frame.

– False: The image is well-framed but does not adhere to an identifiable golden ratio; the placement of elements appears arbitrary or based on another logic (rule of thirds, centering, etc.)."

Does the framing of the image use The Golden Spiral?
Score type: Boolean.","This parameter identifies whether the image composition follows the logic of a golden spiral, also known as a Fibonacci spiral: a logarithmic curve that gradually guides the eye toward a central or peripheral focal point. This construction relies on proportions related to the golden ratio, with visual elements strategically placed along the spiral or at its inflection points. This criterion only considers cases where the image's visual structure clearly corresponds to this spiral pattern.

Examples:
– True: The visual shapes, masses, or lines are organized around a perceptible spiral, which naturally leads the eye in a progressive movement toward a center or key point.

– False: The image contains curves or spirals, but without a clear alignment with a golden spiral; the visual dynamic does not follow this precise flow."

These diagonals can be formed by objects, architectural elements, shadows, or visual alignments, provided they play an active role in the interpretation of the image. This criterion only applies if the diagonal lines are visually dominant and contribute to the perceptual organization of the scene.

Examples:
– True: A staircase ascending at an angle, a diagonal road intersecting the image, or an obliquely oriented object creating directional tension.

– False: Slightly inclined but non-structuring lines, or diagonal elements not perceived as visual guides."
27,Golden Triangles,Framing,Boolean,Does the image framing use the Golden Triangle?,Divides the image into triangles to energize the composition with inclined lines.,"Dividing the image into triangles to energize the composition with inclined lines.
Does the image framing use the Golden Triangles?
Score type: Boolean.","This parameter identifies whether the image composition is organized according to the principle of golden triangles: an implicit division of the frame into slanted triangles, designed to energize the scene through well-distributed oblique lines. This structure relies on diagonal lines that divide the space into triangular sections, within which key visual elements are placed or aligned. This criterion only applies to images where this geometry is perceptible in the overall organization, and not simply the presence of triangular shapes in the subject.

Examples:
– True: The subject or several visual masses are part of an oblique composition where the frame can be mentally divided into coherent triangles.

– False: The image contains triangular elements or oblique lines, but without a perceptible structure based on a triangular division of the frame."

This can be true symmetry (mirror image) or a very similar distribution between the two halves of the image. This criterion only applies if this symmetrical organization actively structures the composition, and not in cases of simple overall balance without reflection or apparent duplication.

Examples:
– True: The image shows frontal symmetry (e.g., centered facade, reflection in water, mirrored portrait), with a balanced alignment of elements on either side of an axis.

– False: The image is well-balanced, but without symmetrical construction; the elements are not reflected or distributed equally."

It determines the geometric or perceptual logic that organizes the arrangement of visual elements: grids, spirals, leading lines, axes of symmetry, etc. The choice should be based on the most clearly identifiable pattern, even if others are present in a secondary role.

Possible options:
– Rule of Thirds: The composition follows a grid of horizontal and vertical thirds, with the subject or key elements placed on the lines or intersections.

– Golden Rectangles: The scene is organized around rectangles with golden proportions, suggesting a balanced mathematical structure.

– Golden Spiral: The image follows a curved and progressive visual flow, guiding the eye along the Fibonacci spiral.

– Diagonal Leading Lines: The composition is built on dominant oblique lines, directing the gaze and adding dynamism to the scene.

– Golden Triangles: The image is structured with slanted triangles, creating balanced tension.

Perceptible haze manifests as a loss of sharpness in the background, a diffuse light haze, and a softening of colors or edges. The score reflects the degree of visual certainty that this effect is indeed due to haze, and not to optical blur or digital processing.

Scoring examples:
- 0: The image is sharp and contrasted across all planes, with no signs of haze or light scattering.
- 50: A haze is perceptible in the distance, but the image remains clear; the effect is probable but moderate.

Haze reduces overall clarity and saturation, giving the scene a dull, faded look.","Look at the image, is there any part of the image where haze causes a reduction in clarity or makes that part of the image appear dull? If the haze results in a noticeable lack of sharpness, contrast, or color saturation in any section of the image, it should be considered as haze. Pay attention to areas that appear washed out, blurred, or foggy, which could indicate atmospheric haze affecting the image.
Score type: Boolean.","This setting detects the presence of optical haze or unwanted haze affecting all or part of the image. This phenomenon manifests as a noticeable loss of clarity, saturation, or contrast, often perceived as a whitish cast, a washed-out appearance, or a diffuse blur. It can be caused by a dirty, fogged, or defective lens, or by an accumulation of optical residue. The effect must be visually perceptible and distinct from an intentional aesthetic style or a naturally hazy atmosphere.

Examples:
– True: Part of the image appears blurred, dull, or hazy in a way that is inconsistent with the scene; clarity and contrast are abnormally reduced.

– False: The image is sharp and saturated, or the hazy appearance is clearly atmospheric or intentionally incorporated as an artistic effect."

These spots remain stationary across frames, typically visible against bright, uniform backgrounds.","Look at the image, is there any sign of a dusty or unclear lens? You should consider whether there are noticeable spots, streaks, or hazy areas across the image, which could indicate dirt, dust, or smudges on the lens. Pay attention to areas where light reflections might appear distorted or blurry, and assess if these inconsistencies affect the overall clarity and sharpness of the image.
Score type: Boolean.","This setting detects the visible presence of dust, dirt, or smudges on the lens or sensor, manifesting as blurry, dark, or streaky areas in the image. These marks generally appear in bright or uniform areas and are not related to objects in the scene. They can locally distort light or impair sharpness. This criterion should only be validated if the image shows clear signs of optical contamination, and not simply normal variations in the background.

Does the image display chromatic aberration around sharp transitions between dark and bright areas?
Score type: Boolean.","This parameter detects the presence of chromatic aberration in the image, generally perceptible as fine colored fringes (purple, green, magenta, etc.) located along high-contrast edges. This optical phenomenon results from the difficulty some lenses have in focusing all wavelengths of light to the same point.

Does the image show a starburst effect with sharp, linear rays emanating from bright light sources?
Score type: Boolean.","This setting identifies the presence of a starburst effect, visible as sharp, linear beams of light emanating from a point light source (e.g., sun, lamp, spotlight). This symmetrical pattern is caused by the diffraction of light through the diaphragm blades, often amplified at small apertures. It should be clearly distinguishable from diffuse halos or optical flares and only applies to images where these beams form a perceptible starburst pattern.

Examples:
– True: A streetlamp at night generates regular, star-shaped beams of light; filtered sunlight produces a well-defined geometric burst.

– False: The light is diffuse, without structured radiation; the image contains a flare, halo, or overexposure without a starburst pattern."
37,Moire,Lens Quality,Boolean,,"A wavy or repetitive interference pattern that appears when the camera’s sensor sampling interacts with fine, repetitive textures, such as fabrics or screens.

## 🎭 ROLE

You are an AI specializing in photographic analysis. Your task is to assess the **overall brightness** of an image. This does not concern technical exposure or the directional quality of light, but only the **overall perceived brightness**.

---

## 🧪 3-STEP METHOD

1. **Blurred Reading (optional but recommended)**: Start by analyzing a heavily blurred version of the image to neutralize details and estimate the perceived average brightness.

2. **Observing Dominant Areas**: Identify the relative proportion of light and dark areas in the image.

3. **Rating on the Brightness Scale**: Assign a score between 0 and 100 based on the overall visual balance.

---

## 📊 RATING GUIDELINES

| Overall Lighting | Light Dominance | Extensive Dark Areas | Indicative Rating |

| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |

| Very High | Yes | No | 85–100 |

| Moderate Light | Yes | Low | 65–80 |

| Balanced | Balanced | Balanced | 45–60 |

| Low | Low | Dominant | 20–40 |

| Very Dark | No | Yes | 0–20 |

---

## 🌐 EXTREME BLUR READING (optional but recommended)

This method allows you to:

* neutralize the influence of local details and fine contrasts,
* reproduce a **perceptual average of overall illumination**,
* mimic how a photographer assesses the clarity of an image at first glance.

👉 Recommended **especially in cases with high dynamic range** (e.g., nighttime urban scenes, dark staircases with spot lighting).

---

## 🎯 PARAMETER PURPOSE: Brightness (Parameter 40)

Brightness **corresponds to the perceived light intensity on an overall scale. An image can be:

* dark (low key),
* balanced,
* bright (high key).

⚠️ This criterion does not judge **technical exposure** (blocked or blown-out areas), **light direction**, or **contrast**. It only considers the **overall impression of illumination**.

---

## 🔢 RATING SCALE

* `0–15`: Near total darkness (night scene with no light source)
* `20–35`: Controlled dark atmosphere (low key)
* `40–55`: Natural lighting, visual balance
* `60–75`: Bright image, perception of openness or clarity
* `80–100`: High key or extremely bright atmosphere

📌 A very dark image can receive a low rating without this calling into question its quality — **the rating does not evaluate artistic intention or achievement.**

---

## ❌ MISTAKES TO AVOID

* Do not confuse **overall brightness** and **exposure quality**.

* Do not be misled by locally bright areas or vivid colors.

* Do not overestimate the light based on isolated or point reflections.

## 🎭 ROLE

You are an **expert exposure photo critic**. You receive an image and must assess **its exposure quality**, that is, the balance between the captured light and the subject's legibility, regardless of the visual style.

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE OF THE SCORE (IMPORTANT)

Assign an **absolute score out of 100** according to this scale:

* `0` = Clearly **underexposed** image: very dark, lost information, illegible subject.

* `50` = **Correct exposure**: legible image, preserved details, no blown-out or blocked-up areas.

* `100` = Clearly **overexposed** image: blown-out areas, lost details, uncontrolled light.

The rating must reflect **the degree of deviation from a neutral exposure**.

---

## 🔍 EVALUATION METHODOLOGY

### 🧩 1. **Identify the visual style**

Start by identifying the lighting intention among the following:

* **High-key**: intentionally bright, white, soft, pastel image.

* **Standard**: balanced image, moderate contrast, neutral lighting.

* **Low-key**: dark, dramatic image, high contrast, black background.

⚠️ **Don't confuse lighting style with exposure.** A well-executed low-key image can be correctly exposed, just like a well-executed high-key image.

> ⚠ **Caution: an image can be underexposed even without blown-out or blocked-up areas.**
>
> * A **high-key** image without blown-out areas but too dull is **underexposed**.

> * A low-key image without blocked-up areas but too bright is overexposed.

> * **Exposure is judged within the context of the visual style.**

### 🔦 2. **Exposure Analysis**

Indicate whether the actual exposure of the image respects its stylistic intention. Consider the following:

* **Is the subject clearly legible?** (even with visual blur)
* **Are there any unjustified blown-out or blocked-up areas?**
* **Does the contrast hinder the image's clarity?**
* **Is the stylistic intention betrayed by poor exposure?**

### 🎯 3. **How ​​to assign a rating?**

#### Standard image

* Good exposure → 50
* A little dark → 30–45
* Very dark / illegible → 0–25
* A little too bright → 55–70
* Blown-out / lost areas → 80–100

#### High-key style

* High-key well executed → 50
* Overexposed, without Details → `70–100`
* Not clear enough to be believable → `30–45`

#### Low-key style

* Legible, balanced low-key → `50`
* Too blocked up, too dark → `0–30`
* Not bold enough (neither light nor dark) → `40–45`

## 🛑 MISTAKES TO AVOID

* ❌ Don't rely solely on **overall brightness**.

* ❌ Don't overestimate a poorly executed high-key image.

* ❌ Don't penalize a well-executed low-key image.

Both must be detected and rated according to their **actual visual presence**, whether unintentional or intentionally added.

✳️ **Caution**: Development or post-processing can **intensify** existing grain (via contrast, clarity, black and white toning, etc.) or add more for aesthetic reasons. The analysis must always be done **visually**: note what is visible in the image, regardless of its origin or intention, understanding the **difference between digital noise (often colored, random) and aesthetic grain (often monochrome, regular)**. Both must be detected and noted according to their **actual visual presence**, whether unintentional or intentionally added.

* **Monochrome** (luminance noise)
* **Colored** (chromatic noise)
* **Uniform** (diffuse noise across the entire image)
* **Localized** (dark areas, blurred transitions, etc.)

The goal is to determine whether this grain **impairs the image's legibility** or **serves a particular aesthetic**.

---

## 🧪 WHAT IT IS NOT

* This is **not** an artistic evaluation of analog grain (intentional film grain).

* This is **not** simply a blurry or soft interpretation: blur can mask noise, but it doesn't replace it.

* This is **not** a sharpness assessment, although the two can interact.

---

## 📏 EVALUATION CRITERIA

### 🧮 Perceived Grain Levels (Calibration Guide)

* **0–10**: No grain, perfectly clean image.

* **11–30**: Very subtle grain, visible only in certain areas (shadows, blurs), does not interfere with readability.

* **31–60**: Moderate grain, generally visible, begins to affect fine textures without impairing readability.

* **61–80**: Strong grain, impacted readability, noticeable roughness on faces and flat areas.

* **81–100**: Excessive grain, noise effect, or major visual disturbance.

1. **Presence**: Is the noise visible to the naked eye (in dark, blurry, uniform areas, or at the edges)?

2. **Type of Noise**:

* Luminance (black and white grain)
* Chromatic (color blemishes)

3. **Distribution**: Is it diffuse or concentrated? Does it affect certain key areas (faces, blurred backgrounds, dark areas)?

4. **Perceived Impact**:

* Does it impair the image's legibility?

* Does it add aesthetic texture or is it a technical flaw?

---

## 🌀 SPECIAL CASES

* **Irregular or Hybrid Exposure**: Some very dark or overexposed areas can visually mask or amplify the noise. The image should be interpreted accordingly.

* **Blur/Noise Conflict**: Background blur doesn't always smooth the image. In many photos, noise is more visible precisely in the blurred areas, especially in the background. It then manifests as noticeable grain, a ""cracked"" or grainy effect.

* **Added Grain in Post-Production**: Some images have grain intentionally added for aesthetic reasons. Even if this noise is intentional, it must be objectively evaluated based on its **perceived intensity**, its **distribution**, and its **visual impact**. The goal is not to judge the creative intent, but the **actual presence of grain**, whether natural, digital, or artistic.

---

## 🔎 READING TIP

Perform an **overall blurred reading** to isolate the general structure of the image. If localized or grainy disturbances persist within this blur (even perceptually), this reinforces the presence of noise.

---

## 🧭 Contextual Use of EXIF ​​Metadata *(if available)*

If EXIF ​​metadata is accessible, you can use it as a **contextual clue for interpretation**, but never consider it an automatic justification. In particular:

* **High ISO** (>3200): Noise may be expected, but its acceptability must remain **visually assessed**.

* **Sensor type** (e.g., smartphone, Micro Four Thirds, APS-C, full-frame, medium format): Can influence noise tolerance.

* **Camera model or brand**: Some cameras apply automatic processing (smoothing, noise reduction) that must be taken into account.

⚠️ **Caution**:

* Never penalize an image for the absence of EXIF ​​data.

* Do not **over-justify** poor quality based solely on EXIF ​​data.

* This criterion should **never take precedence over direct visual analysis**.

Score type: text","This setting identifies, from the viewer's perspective, whether the light illuminating the scene appears ambient (uncontrolled) or directed by the photographer (controlled).

– Ambient light refers to diffuse or natural lighting, such as daylight, indoor fluorescent lights, or streetlights, without any obvious signs of direction or shaping.

– Directed light corresponds to a clearly controlled, focused, or oriented source (flash, spotlight, light sculpted onto the subject).

– Both types can coexist if an ambient scene is complemented by a point light source.

– The ""None"" category applies if no identifiable light source can be deduced from the image (e.g., flat rendering, abstraction, virtual lighting).

At 100: The Hard.
Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","This parameter measures the perceived harshness of the lighting in the image by analyzing how light shapes forms, shadows, and transitions. Soft light produces blurred shadows with soft edges and gradual transitions between light and shadow. Hard light creates sharp, defined shadows with sharp contours and pronounced modeling. This criterion should not be confused with the overall contrast of the image: it focuses solely on the directional quality and diffusion of light.

Examples of ratings:
- 0: Very diffuse light with no pronounced shadows; transitions are soft, as in cloudy or filtered light.

- 50: The lighting exhibits both moderate shadows and soft edges.

- 100: The light is very harsh: shadows are sharp and defined, and volumes are strongly sculpted by point sources."

Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","This parameter measures the perceived color temperature of the image, that is, the visual cast ranging from blue (cool) to orange (warm). A cool temperature results in a bluish, neutral, or slightly greenish cast, evoking cool, morning, or artificial light. A warm temperature produces an orange, gold, or reddish cast, associated with evening light, warmth, or an intimate atmosphere. This score reflects the overall tone of the image, regardless of its saturation or brightness.

Examples of scores:
- 0: The image has a strong blue or cyan cast, giving a cold or metallic feel.

High harmony results in a fluid, visually pleasing composition in which no element appears dissonant or arbitrary. This criterion does not depend on a particular style, but rather on the perceived relationship between the visual components that structure the image.

Examples of scoring:
– 0: The image is visually chaotic, with no clear connection between shapes, textures, or colors; it gives an impression of disorder or incoherence.

– 50: Some elements harmonize visually, while others appear less integrated; the image conveys partial harmony.

– 100: The entire image forms a visually coherent whole, with a clear complementarity between textures, shapes, and colors."

Impression of movement rated from 0 (no movement) to 100 (lots of visible movement).
Score type: continuous score between 0 and 100.","This parameter measures the intensity of perceived movement in the image. The movement can be real (a moving subject, motion blur, a dynamic pose), or simply suggested by lines of tension, an unbalanced composition, or an interrupted gesture. A still image can therefore convey a strong impression of movement if its visual structure clearly suggests dynamism. Conversely, a frozen or posed scene, without perceptible tension, will be considered static.

Examples of the rating:
- 0: The image is completely static, without a dynamic pose or composition suggesting movement.
- 50: The image contains a subject whose pose suggests movement, or a slight visual tension that evokes imminent action.
- 100: The movement is obvious: motion blur, a subject in mid-jump, or a visual effect that clearly draws the eye in a strong direction."
